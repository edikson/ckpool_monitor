# ckpool_monitor
This is an ongoing personal development project to monitor the mining pool ckpool. I am streaming the development every Tuesday at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time. Join me and watch the pure noobishness and help me not be dumb. 

I welcome and constructive comments and tips that may help as I'm really new to all of this and definitely need all the help I can get. 

Long term this will be getting a full window gui and the whole treatment. 

Next week I'll be finishing up the database calls and builds after that I will be building out the functions to poll for the pool and user stats, from there it's GUI time.
