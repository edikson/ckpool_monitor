# ckpool_monitor
This is an ongoing personal development project to monitor the mining pool ckpool. I am streaming the development every Tuesday at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time. Join me and watch the pure noobishness and help me not be dumb. 

I welcome and constructive comments and tips that may help as I'm really new to all of this and definitely need all the help I can get. 

Long term this will be getting a full window gui and the whole treatment. 

I do believe the database calls are finisherd though there is some cleanup I'd like to do that I think would be appropriate or at least be helpful, have to do some digging to see if it's worth doing. 

Next week on 13 November I'll be starting into the web calls to get pool and user stats from ckpool so join and laugh at my deranged mumbling to myself.
